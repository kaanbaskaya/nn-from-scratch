# Neural Network From Scratch
Welcome! This site documents my journey to build a neural network **from scratch** (no external ML libraries).  
Youâ€™ll find my plan, math derivations, experiments.

## Quick Links
- [Project Plan](00_plan.html)
- [Backprop Math](01_math_backprop.html)
- [Experiments](experiments/)

### Project Goals
- Implement a minimal feed-forward neural network using only the Python standard library.
- Understand forward/backward propagation, losses, activations, and training dynamics.
- Run small experiments on Iris first; later extend to other datasets.
